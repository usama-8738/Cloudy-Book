## üìù **About the Project**

**Cloudy Book** is a fast, secure, and user-friendly React application that allows users to store their notes on the cloud. Each user can register, log in, and manage their personal notes seamlessly. The app leverages modern technologies like **React**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** to provide a smooth and responsive experience.

### **Key Features**
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login for personalized note management.
- **Cloud Storage**: Notes are stored securely on the cloud using MongoDB.
- **Fast and Lightweight**: Built with performance in mind, ensuring quick load times and responsiveness.
- **Context API**: State management is handled using React's Context API (no Redux!).
- **Full-Stack Application**: Frontend built with React, backend powered by Express, and database managed with MongoDB.
